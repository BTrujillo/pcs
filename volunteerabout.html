              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>Our academically focused mentoring program puts more emphasis on building a one-on-one relationship between a mentor and a mentee. It also gives mentors more flexibility to spend time talking with their mentees about both academic and non-academic issues. We are looking for caring individuals, who will help provide youth, who are at risk of educational failure with academic and social support, counsel, friendship, reinforcement and a constructive example.

              <h3>Program Design</h3>
              <p>The Academic Mentoring Program, hereafter referred to as AMP, is designed to provide upper elementary and middle school students with caring and consistent mentors, with a focus on academic mentoring. The AMP concentrates on, but is not limited to, fostering children who may have academic challenges, behavioral issues, emotional trauma, and/or have a parent who is incarcerated. The goal is to improve the aspirations and academic achievement of the students.

              <h3>Program Description</h3>
              <p>The mentors are volunteers recruited from colleges and universities. Prospective mentors are required to complete a thorough application and screening process. After mentors are screened for eligibility, a program orientation and training is provided. The interactive training includes a discussion of the roles and responsibilities of the mentors, time commitment, consistency of participation and the clarification of expectations and boundaries of the relationship with the mentee. <br><br>After submitting an application, the mentees are interviewed. Mentees are selected on the basis of several factors including a strong desire to participate in the program and parental/guardian consent. Mentors and mentees are matched based on the submitted applications, interviews and on the basis of shared interests regarding a hobby, pastime or career path. After the matching is completed, the mentors/mentees are expected to meet for a minimum of four (4) hours per week for a school semester period and attend program events. <br><br>Once the mentor and mentee are matched, the mentor assists the mentees in their schoolwork assignments. After the mentor and mentee have built sufficient rapport, they are encouraged to begin working on joint projects or activities related to their similar interests. Samples of suggested activities include: creation of entries for science fairs, art exhibits or literary contests; community service projects; musical performances; computer-generated projects; or other school-related assignments.
